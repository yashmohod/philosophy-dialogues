This project is a public conversation between a human thinker and an AI interlocutor.  
It isn’t meant to reach conclusions, but to document the process of reasoning itself — the dance between physics, philosophy, and personality.  

All dialogues are deterministic, emergent, and (hopefully) enlightening.
